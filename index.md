## AITA Classifier

`r/AmItheA*hole` (AITA) is a community where users seek judgment on whether their actions were the `A*hole` or not. Posts are classified as either negative (the `A*hole`) or positive (not the `A*hole`).

This project aligns with [stance detection](https://doi.org/10.1145/3369026), which involves classifying text as expressing favor, opposition, or neutrality. [Stance detection has been studied in social media platforms like Twitter](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3003433). Additionally, [morality classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9240031?casa_token=IG_eXC9q7NkAAAAA:KCDtycMz9dtUCWgSbGHLirTB7oNwhPwApNIJWJNgyHom_rv8AnsJMLXGkDiqK72t6GZNM_ULsw), which involves assessing the ethical or moral stance of a text, is closely related to this work.

Our project falls in a similar category, which aims to build a morality classifier and generate explanations for why a post was classified as "the `A*hole`" or not.
