# AITA Classifier

#### What is this project about? 
`r/AmItheA*hole` (AITA) is a reddit community where users seek judgment on whether their actions were that of an `A*hole` or not. Posts are classified as either negative (the `A*hole`) or positive (not the `A*hole`). 
We build an AI app that classifies and generates explanation on a given user story whether their actions were right or wrong for the life situation they describes. We used BERT and Llama3 models for classficiation and explanation generation respectively. Check the project report for details related to EDA and modle experiments.
