# Clustering Results

I performed simple kmeans clustering on the dataset for cluster sizes `[2,4,6,8,10,15,20,40,60,80,100]`.

Results did not show much. Most likely due to the large data size and need for a finely tuned tokenizer.

Things to do going forward:
- topic modeling showed good results
- body and title are sometimes disjoint in meaning, might throw off clustering
- need to see if there is relationship with yta and nta

Supervised learning will provide much more insights to relationship between features.
