    "### Summary\n",
    "- Using BertTopic to extract topics and visualize them.\n",
    "- Experimented with doing topic modelling on title, title + body, and body.\n",
    "- Tried with and without dim reduction using UMAP before visualizing topic clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "- topic modelling on titles gives a nice list of topics. able to visualise the clusters for a subsample of 3000 rows. around 70 topics. \n",
    "- on the entire dataset, around 900 topics. \n",
    "- the body contents are adding lots of noise, the extracted topics are mostly stopwords. Maybe there is room for tuning the parameters.\n",
    "- dim reduction just speeds up the visualization, not much visual difference. \n"
